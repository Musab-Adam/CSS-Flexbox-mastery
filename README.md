## My Project

### Project Built

- A Responsive navigation bar
- A features section with three cards in a row
- A multi-column pricing table
- A row of testimonials
- A Single that links the 4 projects

### What I learned

I learned flexbox to improve my frontend development skills,
i understand how flexbox working and how to place box in perfect direction by justifying and aligning it,
i also learn how to display card or container in a row or column in theoritical and practical aspects by building three four projects separately and integrate them in a single page to gain the real world projects idea.

### Continued development

my next focus is CSS grid.
